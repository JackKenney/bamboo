# bamboo

A library of functions that consume Pandas dataframes and return them refactored.

## Getting Started

It is written in Python 3.6, but will *likely* work for other versions. Untested.

### Prerequisites

To run all functions in the library, you must install the following packages via pip.
```
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn
```

### Installing

There are currently not instructions on how to install this via pip or another software like that, though it is a Python library. 
You may clone the repo or download the main file directly.

## Running the tests

Tests soon to come.

## Built With

The required python libraries in the *Installing* section.
